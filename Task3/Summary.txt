This code is a CUDA program that tries to crack a password by generating all possible combinations of a 4-character string consisting of 2 lowercase letters and 2 digits. The program defines several CUDA kernel functions including "copy_strings", "compare_strings" and "CudaCrypt". "copy_strings" and "compare_strings" are used as CUDA-specific versions of the standard C library functions "strcpy" and "strcmp", which cannot be used in GPU code. "CudaCrypt" is a CUDA kernel function that encrypts a given raw password by applying a series of mathematical operations and checks if the encrypted password matches the given encoded password. The main function "crack" is executed on the GPU using blocks and threads, it generates a raw password using the given alphabet and number arrays, encrypts it and compares the result with the given encoded password.
