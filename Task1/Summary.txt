This code is a program that multiplies two matrices together using multiple threads. It uses the pthread library to create and manage threads. The program uses several functions, including one to find the number of rows and columns in a matrix, one to multiply the matrices, and several to manipulate the matrices, such as creating, writing to a file and displaying matrices. The program includes several global variables and a mutex for thread synchronization. The program also includes a function to calculate one element of the resulting matrix by taking the dot product of a row in the first matrix and a column in the second matrix. The program opens a file named "Matrix_multithrd_output.txt" in write mode and writes the resulting matrix to this file.
