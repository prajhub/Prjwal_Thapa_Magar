This code applies a box blur effect to an image using a CUDA kernel function on the GPU. It takes in the memory locations of the input and output images, as well as their dimensions. The kernel function loops through the input image pixel by pixel, calculating the average value of the red, green, and blue color channels for the pixels within a 5x5 square surrounding the current pixel, and writes the resulting values to the output image. The transparency channel of the original image is retained in the output image. The code also uses lodepng library to decode and encode image. The image is read from file "2059745_image.png" and the output is written to "2059745_blur.png".
